## From the rcm docs, quickstart:

This section is for those who do not have an existing dotfiles directory and whose dotfiles are standard.

* Add your rc files to a dotfiles directory with mkrc(1).

```
mkrc .zshrc .gitconfig .tigrc
```

* Synchronize your home directory with rcup(1)

```
rcup -v
```
